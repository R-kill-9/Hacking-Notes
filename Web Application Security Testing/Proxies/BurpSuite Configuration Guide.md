## 1. Install Burp Suite

Before anything, you need to install **Burp Suite** on your system.

- **Download**: Go to the official Burp Suite website: Burp Suite Download and download the version you need (Community or Professional).
    
    - **Community** is free but has limited features compared to the Professional version.
    - **Professional** is a paid version with advanced features like automated vulnerability scanning, advanced reporting, etc.

Once installed, open **Burp Suite**. You'll be greeted with a prompt to select whether you want to start a new project or use an existing one. Choose **"Temporary Project"** for testing or create a new one.

## 2. Set Up Proxy

Burp Suite primarily functions as a **man-in-the-middle proxy** between your browser and the target web application. It captures, inspects, and manipulates HTTP/S traffic.

- **Default Proxy Settings**:
    - Burp Suite listens on **127.0.0.1:8080** (local IP and port 8080).
    - This means your browser’s traffic must be routed through **Burp's proxy** to inspect the requests and responses.

#### How to confirm:￼￼How

- Open Burp Suite and go to the **Proxy** tab, then select **Options**.
- Ensure that **Proxy Listeners** are enabled on `127.0.0.1:8080`. If the port is blocked or you need to change it, click **Edit** and select a different port.

At this point, Burp Suite is ready to intercept HTTP/S traffic but requires further configuration in your browser to start capturing the data.

## 3. Configure Your Browser to Use BurpSuite as Proxy

For Burp Suite to capture web traffic, you need to **direct your browser to use Burp's proxy**.

- **Why?** Your browser typically sends requests directly to the web server, but when you configure a proxy, it sends all requests to Burp first. Burp then forwards them to the server, and you can intercept, modify, and log these requests.

#### Manual Proxy Configuration

- **Firefox**:
    1. Open **Firefox** and navigate to **Options** > **General** > **Network Settings**.
    2. Click **Settings**.
    3. Select **Manual proxy configuration**.
    4. Set **HTTP Proxy** to `127.0.0.1` and port to `8080` (Burp’s default settings).
    5. Check the box **Use this proxy server for all protocols** (this applies the proxy to HTTP, HTTPS, and other protocols).
    6. Click **OK** to save the settings.
- **Chrome**:
    - Chrome uses the **system proxy** settings, meaning it will automatically use the proxy if your system is configured correctly. However, you can also manually set a proxy through extensions like **Proxy SwitchyOmega** for easy switching.
    - **Windows**: Open **Settings** > **Network & Internet** > **Proxy**, and set the proxy server to `127.0.0.1` and port `8080`.
    - **macOS/Linux**: Go to **System Preferences** > **Network** > **Advanced** > **Proxies**, and set the **HTTP Proxy** to `127.0.0.1:8080`.

## 4. Install BurpSuite's SSL Certificate
- **Go to the Burp Suite Proxy page**:
    - Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
    - This will prompt you to download the Burp Suite CA certificate, which is required to trust the intercepted SSL traffic.
- **Install the certificate in Firefox**:
    1. Click the download link for the certificate.
    2. Once downloaded, go to **Options** > **Privacy & Security** > **Certificates** > **View Certificates**.
    3. Click **Import** and select the Burp certificate you just downloaded.
    4. Check the option to trust the certificate for identifying websites, then click **OK**.
- **Install the certificate in Chrome**:
    - **For macOS/Linux**:
        1. Open **Keychain Access** (macOS) or **System Certificates** (Linux).
        2. Import the Burp Suite certificate and make sure it’s added to the **trusted root certification authorities**.
    - **For Windows**:
        1. Go to **Control Panel** > **Internet Options** > **Content** > **Certificates** > **Import**.
        2. Follow the wizard to import the certificate and ensure it’s trusted.

Once installed, your browser will trust the SSL certificates generated by Burp Suite, and you can intercept HTTPS traffic without errors or warnings.

## 5. Configure FoxyProxy (Alternative Method for Proxy Configuration)

If you prefer not to manually switch the proxy settings in your browser every time, **FoxyProxy** is a popular browser extension that makes managing proxy settings easier.

#### What is FoxyProxy?

**FoxyProxy** is a browser extension available for both **Firefox** and **Chrome** that allows you to quickly configure and switch between multiple proxy servers without having to navigate through the browser settings every time.

#### How to Set Up FoxyProxy with Burp Suite:

1. **Install FoxyProxy Extension**:
    - For **Firefox**: Install from [FoxyProxy Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/).
    - For **Chrome**: Install from FoxyProxy Chrome Extension.
2. **Configure Proxy in FoxyProxy**:
    - Once installed, click on the FoxyProxy icon in the browser toolbar.
    - Click **Options** to open the configuration page.
    - Add a **New Proxy**:
        - **Proxy Type**: Select **HTTP**.
        - **Proxy IP address**: Enter `127.0.0.1`.
        - **Proxy Port**: Set it to `8080` (or whatever port you configured Burp to listen on).
        - Save the settings.
3. **Switching Between Proxies**:
    - With FoxyProxy configured, you can easily toggle between Burp Suite’s proxy and any other proxy you use, depending on your testing needs.
    - To start capturing traffic, simply enable the Burp Suite proxy in FoxyProxy. When you're done, switch back to your regular proxy.

By using **FoxyProxy**, you can simplify the process of switching between Burp Suite and other proxy settings without having to manually configure the browser each time.
