`.ipa` files are signed app archives used to distribute iOS apps. They are typically not accessible directly unless the app was manually installed (e.g., via Xcode). Apple enforces a **restrictive ecosystem**, making `.ipa` extraction non-trivial.

## ipatool

[`ipatool`](https://github.com/majd/ipatool) is a command-line utility to interact with Appleâ€™s App Store API and fetch signed `.ipa` files using valid Apple credentials.

It requires authentication and is typically used with purchased or free apps tied to the Apple ID.

#### Authentication

Before downloading apps, authenticate with your Apple ID:
```bash
ipatool auth login -e your_email@example.com
```
This creates a local session token used for API requests.

#### Searching Apps

To locate the exact app name or bundle ID:
```bash
ipatool search "App Name"
```
This returns metadata like `bundleIdentifier` (used to request the actual `.ipa`).

## Info.plist 

The `Info.plist` file inside the app bundle stores metadata (e.g., permissions, version, capabilities). Sometimes, it may be stored in binary format and unreadable directly.

To decode:
```bash
plutil -i Info.plist -o DecodedInfo.plist
```
