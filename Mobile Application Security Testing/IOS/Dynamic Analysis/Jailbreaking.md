**Jailbreaking** is the process of gaining elevated privileges on iOS devices by exploiting kernel or system protections. It allows arbitrary code execution, often via spawning an SSH shell, and modifies system behavior to bypass Appleâ€™s restrictions [The Apple Wiki](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/Jailbreak?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Purpose and Capabilities:

- Grants **root access** to the device and access to protected system areas.
- Enables installation of unsigned apps, tweaks, and modifications not allowed by Apple.
- Often installs a package manager like Cydia to manage third-party repositories.
- Overcomes many OS-level constraints (locked bootloader, AMFI, KPP, etc.).


## Jailbreak Types (as described in The Apple Wiki):

- **Tethered:** Device needs re-jailbreaking after every reboot.
- **Semi-tethered:** Jailbreak persists only until reboot; off-laptop the device boots un-jailbroken.
- **Untethered:** Fully permanent jailbreak (less common nowadays).
- Exploits modern protections using memory patching rather than direct kernel overwrites [The Apple Wiki](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/Jailbreak?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
