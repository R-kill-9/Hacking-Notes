## Developer Account (Apple ID provisioning):

- Since **Xcode 7**, you can deploy apps to your device using only a free Apple ID, no paid developer account is required [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4952820/test-ios-app-on-device-without-apple-developer-program-or-jailbreak?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- Paid Developer Program offers additional entitlements (e.g., in-app purchases, Game Center) not available with free provisioning.


## Apple Configurator & Developer Mode:

- To enable **Developer Mode** on iOS 16+, you can use Apple Configurator:
    - Connect the device to Configurator and load an IPA to trigger the Developer Mode prompt [Apple Support Community](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254204686?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- This is necessary for installing apps via Configurator or Xcode.


## Signing IPA Files (for Jailbreak tools):

- Jailbreak IPA files must be signed to run on iOS devices.
- Using a **developer certificate** (from a developer account) avoids the need to manually "trust" the certificate on the device and bypasses the temporary 7-day limit [ElcomSoft blog](https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2019/02/physical-acquisition-ios-11-4-and-11-4-1/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- A signed jailbreak IPA with a developer certificate remains valid for **1 year**, while those signed with a free Apple ID expire in **7 days**.
