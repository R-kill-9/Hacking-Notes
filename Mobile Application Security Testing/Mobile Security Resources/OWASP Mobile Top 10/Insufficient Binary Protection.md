This vulnerability refers to the lack of security controls that make it harder for attackers to reverse engineer, tamper with or modify a mobile application's binary. Without proper protection mechanisms, the application becomes easier to analyze and exploit.

## Common Issues

- No code obfuscation or packing    
- No anti-debugging or anti-tampering mechanisms
- Exposed sensitive constants (API keys, secrets) in the binary
- Easy static and dynamic analysis due to readable symbols and method names

---

## Lack of Code Obfuscation

Apps without obfuscation expose readable class names, method identifiers and logic paths, making it easier for attackers to understand the application flow.

### Risks:

- Disclosure of proprietary intellectual property
- Easier identification of hardcoded credentials
- Simplified modification or repackaging of the app


#### Attack Process

- Decompile the APK using tools like jadx or apktool    
- Read source-like code, locate sensitive logic or secrets
- Extract API keys, endpoints, or authentication flows

---

## Loss of API Keys and Intellectual Property

Sensitive values such as third-party service keys, internal API endpoints or encryption keys may be exposed within the codebase.

#### Attack Process

- Perform static analysis with decompilation tools
- Search for strings or constants that resemble tokens or URLs
- Use extracted keys in external tools (e.g., Postman) to access backend systems

---

## Reverse Engineering

Attackers can fully reverse engineer the app's logic to understand authentication, cryptography, or in-app purchase mechanisms due to weak binary protections.

#### Attack Process

- Extract APK or IPA from the device
- Use disassemblers or decompilers to view implementation details    
- Modify control flow or remove security checks (e.g., SSL pinning, login gates)


---

## Dynamic Analysis to Bypass Authentication

Apps without runtime protections allow instrumentation using tools like Frida or Xposed. This enables attackers to hook into functions and bypass checks such as login validation or licensing.

#### Attack Process

- Install the app in a rooted or jailbroken environment
- Attach Frida to the app process    
- Hook sensitive methods (e.g., login validation, certificate pinning)
- Return spoofed responses to bypass authentication or gain elevated access
