Mobile applications come in three main types: native, mobile web, and hybrid. Each type has different development approaches, performance levels, and access to device features. 

## Native Applications

- **Definition:** Built specifically for one platform (iOS or Android) using platform-specific languages.
- **Languages:**
    - iOS: Swift, Objective-C
    - Android: Kotlin, Java
- **Characteristics:**
    - Installed via App Store or Google Play
    - High performance with full access to device hardware and features (camera, GPS, push notifications)
    - Smooth and responsive user experience

## Mobile Web Applications

- **Definition:** Web pages optimized for mobile devices, accessed through mobile browsers.
- **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Characteristics:**
    - No installation needed; runs inside browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
    - Platform-independent and accessible from any device
    - Limited access to device features
    - Requires constant internet connection

## Hybrid Applications

- **Definition:** Web apps wrapped inside a native container, combining web technologies with some native capabilities.
- **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frameworks: Ionic, Cordova, React Native)
- **Characteristics:**
    - Installed like native apps
    - Partial access to native device features via plugins
    - Slower performance than native apps
    - Easier cross-platform development and maintenance
