This is an example scenario where an Android app has a function that checks if a user’s password is correct. The function might look like this in Java:

```java
public boolean verifyPassword(String password)
```

The application might perform the password check by comparing the input password with a stored hashed password, and we want to intercept this function to bypass the password check (a common approach in penetration testing).

## 1. Identify the Target Function

We are targeting the `verifyPassword(String password)` function of the `com.example.app.SecurityManager` class. Our goal is to bypass the password verification and allow the attacker to login without providing the correct password.

## 2. Analyze the Application (Dynamic Analysis)

Before writing the Frida script, you can use Frida’s `frida-trace` tool to trace method calls in the application. Start by listing the available methods in the target app:

```bash
frida-trace -U -n com.example.app
```

This will give you a list of methods that are being called in the app, and you can look for the method `verifyPassword`. For now, let’s assume we already identified it as `com.example.app.SecurityManager.verifyPassword`.

## 3. Write the Frida Hooking Script

Now that we know the function signature and the class, we will write a Frida script to hook into `verifyPassword` and modify its behavior.

**Frida Script to Hook `verifyPassword()` and Bypass It:**

```javascript
Java.perform(function () {
    // Get a reference to the SecurityManager class
    var SecurityManager = Java.use("com.example.app.SecurityManager");

    // Hook into the verifyPassword function
    SecurityManager.verifyPassword.overload('java.lang.String').implementation = function(password) {
        console.log("Intercepted password check! Skipping verification.");
        
        // Always return true to bypass the password check
        return true;
    };
});
```

#### Explanation of the Script:

- `Java.use("com.example.app.SecurityManager")`: This gets a reference to the `SecurityManager` class in the app.
- `SecurityManager.verifyPassword.implementation`: This is where we hook into the `verifyPassword` method. By overriding this method, we can change its behavior.
- `return true;`: Instead of allowing the function to perform its actual logic (e.g., comparing the password), we simply return `true`, effectively bypassing the password check.

## 4. Run the Frida Script

After writing the script, you can execute it on the target Android app. Assuming the app is running and the device is connected, you can inject the Frida script using:

```bash
frida -U -f com.example.app -l bypass_password.js
```

## 5. Outcome

Once the Frida script is running, every time the app calls the `verifyPassword` method, it will be intercepted, and the logic will be bypassed. The function will always return `true`, meaning the app will never reject an incorrect password.

For example:

- If the app originally checked whether `password == "correct_password"`, this check would be skipped.

- The attacker can now access sensitive areas or features that are usually protected by the password.
