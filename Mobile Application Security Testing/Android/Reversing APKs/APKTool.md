**APKTool** is a reverse engineering tool for Android applications. It allows developers and security researchers to decompile and recompile APK files for analysis, modification, and debugging.

#### Main Features

- Decodes AndroidManifest.xml and resource files (e.g., layouts, strings).
- Disassembles `.dex` files into **smali** code (an intermediate representation of Dalvik bytecode).
- Rebuilds the original APK from the decoded sources.
- Preserves the original file structure and resource references.
- Supports framework resources required by system apps.

#### Basic Workflow

1. **Decompile APK**

To decompile an APK:

```bash
apktool d app.apk -o output_folder
```

This command extracts:

- `AndroidManifest.xml`
- `res/` (resources)
- `smali/` (disassembled bytecode)
- `assets/`, `lib/`, `META-INF/`, and other folders if present

2. **Modify Files (Optional)**

After decompilation, you can:

- Edit the `AndroidManifest.xml` to change permissions or components.
- Modify resources like layouts or strings.
- Change or analyze smali code to alter app behavior.

> Note: Editing smali code requires a good understanding of how the Dalvik Virtual Machine works.

3. **Rebuild APK**

Once changes are made, recompile the APK:
```bash
apktool b output_folder -o rebuilt.apk
```

4. **Sign the APK**

Before the rebuilt APK can be installed, it must be signed. You can use `jarsigner` or `apksigner` (from the Android SDK):

```bash
jarsigner -keystore mykeystore.keystore rebuilt.apk myalias
```
