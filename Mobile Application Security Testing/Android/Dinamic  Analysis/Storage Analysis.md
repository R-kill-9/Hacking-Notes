Storage analysis focuses on identifying sensitive information stored insecurely on the device. Many applications save data in internal or external storage, shared preferences, or databases. Improper storage practices can lead to data leakage or unauthorized access.

#### 1. Understand Android Storage Options

- **Internal storage** (`/data/data/<package_name>/`)  
    Accessible only to the app, unless the device is rooted.
- **External storage** (`/sdcard/` or `/storage/emulated/0/`)  
    Globally readable and writable. Any app with storage permission can access it.
- **Shared Preferences**  
    Key-value storage usually in `shared_prefs` XML files.
- **SQLite Databases**  
    Located under the `databases/` directory of the app.
- **Cache and Temp files**  
    Often stored under `cache/`, `files/`, or custom directories.

#### 2. Preparation

- Use a **rooted device** or **emulator** to access app data.
- Use `adb` or root file explorers to browse internal directories.

#### 3. Access Application Storage
```bash
adb root
adb shell
cd /data/data/<target_package>/
```
Check folders like:

- `shared_prefs/` – for XML files containing tokens, flags, etc.
- `databases/` – inspect `.db` files with `sqlite3`
- `files/`, `cache/`, `code_cache/` – look for plaintext logs, credentials, or cached responses

#### 4. Analyze Shared Preferences
```bash
cat shared_prefs/<file_name>.xml
```
Look for:

- Auth tokens
- Session IDs
- Usernames/passwords
- Feature flags

#### 5. Analyze Databases
```sql
sqlite3 databases/<db_name>.db
.tables
SELECT * FROM <table_name>;
```
Check for:

- User credentials
- Financial data
- Logs or chat messages

#### 6. Check External Storage
```bash
adb shell
ls /sdcard/Android/data/<target_package>/files/
```
Look for sensitive files in public directories.

#### 7. Key Risks to Identify

- Sensitive data in external storage
- Tokens or passwords stored in plaintext
- Insecure backups or logs
- Lack of encryption
