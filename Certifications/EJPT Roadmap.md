## INE Videos and Labs 
Before tackling the practical machines, I thoroughly studied the **INE eJPT course materials**. This included: 
- Watching all the **INE eJPT videos**, which cover foundational topics like networking, web application security, and system exploitation. 
- Completing **all the INE labs**, gaining hands-on experience with: 
	- Network enumeration. 
	- Vulnerability exploitation. 
	- Privilege escalation techniques. 
	- Reporting findings effectively. 

This solid theoretical and practical foundation was key to approaching the machines confidently.
